# peulbot

Originally, an attempt at a discord bot for tracking Project Euler progress within a group of friends/rivals,
now houses a convolutional neural network (in `captcha/`) for solving the Project Euler captcha required to log in.
The model achieves a ~96.0% single-digit accuracy, with a projected ~81.5% total accuracy.
